# Pricing Barrier Options

Pricing Barrier Options using PDEs in C++.

This was part of our project where we extended a C++ library to price barrier options using PDES. I was the lead developer for this project.

To compile this file, you will need the relevant C++ library dependencies. You can email me at johncai117@gmail.com to ask for it.

To just use it, you can simply load the XLL SUBMISSION.xll file. 

For more explanation, check out the pdf and the ppt files. Thank you.
