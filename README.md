# Pricing Barrier Options

Pricing Barrier Options using PDEs in C++.

This was part of our project where we extended a C++ library to price barrier options using PDES. I was the lead developer for this project.

To compile this file, you will need the relevant C++ library dependencies. You can email me at johncai117@gmail.com to ask for it. You will also need the Armadillo C++ Scientific library.

To just use it, you can simply load the XLL SUBMISSION.xll file and price your barrier options.

For more explanation on the use, check out the pdf and the ppt files.
